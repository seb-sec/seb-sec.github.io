I participated in the Secedu ctf event in 2019 on the 1st November as part of the blue team (in name alone). I was part of the group in the team focusing on binary exploitation, while the other group focused on the web challenges. We managed to solve 2 binary challenges on the day, with the web group solving quite a few more. We ended up winning the competition at the end of the day, it was a great experience!

struct user {
  char *name;
  long access_level;
};

```

There's a call to `malloc()` with
