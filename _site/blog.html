            <p>I participated in the Secedu ctf event in 2019 on the 1st November as part of the blue team (in name alone). I was part of the group in the team focusing on binary exploitation, while the other group focused on the web challenges. We managed to solve 2 binary challenges on the day, with the web group solving quite a few more. We ended up winning the competition at the end of the day, it was a great experience!</p>

            <p>Pico was a fun ctf that had a wide range of challenges, from absolute beginner to some nontrivial (for me) heap exploitation.</p>

<p>I decided to pick out a few of these challenges from the binary exploitation category, make writeups for them and cover some basic exploitation concepts from the point of view of a beginner with only a small amount of programming experience.</p>
