            <a href="/2020/05/01/post.html">TG:HACK 2020 'useless crap' writeup</a>
            <p>This was a fun ctf, even though I spent most of my time on a single challnge (called ‘useless crap’). I learned a lot doing this challenge, and thought I would make a writeup because as far a I know (from the 2 places I’ve looked) this is a unique solution with some cool tricks.</p>

            <a href="/2020/04/29/post.html">FILE exploitation</a>
            <p>Recently I came across a ctf challenge that was exploited by corrupting glibc FILE structures/operations (the bookface challenge in angstromctf2020). I hadn’t come across this type of exploitation before, so I did some more reading on the topic</p>

<p>Corrupting or forging FILE structures can result in arbitrary read/write primitives and code execution, which makes it a cool topic to know about.</p>

            <a href="/2019/11/04/post.html">Secedu ctf 2019</a>
            <p>I participated in the Secedu ctf event in 2019 on the 1st November as part of the blue team (in name alone). I was part of the group in the team focusing on binary exploitation, while the other group focused on the web challenges. We managed to solve 2 binary challenges on the day, with the web group solving quite a few more. We ended up winning the competition at the end of the day, it was a great experience!</p>
